This report provides a detailed analysis of material usage, waste generation, by-product recovery, and their financial impact within the manufacturing pipeline for the period of January 1, 2025, to May 31, 2025. The analysis integrates planning data Bill of Materials with actual operational metrics, leveraging the capabilities of a system like the Material Flow & Recovery Optimizer MFRO app.

Data Utilized for This Analysis:

To perform this complete analysis, the following data was integrated:

Provided Bill of Materials BoM Data: The core structure and planned component requirements for three products JEANS-STR-MEDW-005 with revisions B and C, JEANS-SKY-HRANK-IND with revision A, and POLO-BASIC-NAVY with revision A, including planned Quantity per Unit Net, Loss / Scrap Method, Loss / Scrap Value, Calculated Required Qty Gross, and Sequence / Assembly Step for each component line item. This dataset defines the planned material recipe and anticipated component loss for different products and time periods.

User-Provided Component Cost Data: The actual unit purchase cost for each unique Component SKU used in the BoMs during the analysis period. This allows for calculating the planned and actual financial value of material inputs and component loss.

User-Provided Waste/By-product Master Data: A predefined catalog of all potential waste and by-product streams generated in the manufacturing process. Crucially, this includes:
A clear Classification for each stream Waste or By-product.
An Associated Type Unit Value/Cost e.g., Disposal Cost per KG for waste, Potential Revenue per KG for by-products.
Defined links between the Loss originating from specific Component SKUs as calculated in the BoM and the corresponding Waste/By-product Type actually generated e.g., Fabric loss from Denim SKUs is linked to the "Denim Fabric Scraps" Waste Type; Cardboard loss from Carton SKUs is linked to "Baled Cardboard" By-product Type. It also defines process waste streams not directly tied to BoM components like "Wastewater," "Sludge".

User-Provided Manufacturing Stage Data: A defined sequence of distinct process steps in the manufacturing pipeline e.g., Fabric Receiving, Cutting, Sewing, Washing/Finishing, Packing, etc.. Each Sequence / Assembly Step referenced in the BoM is mapped to one of these stages.

User-Provided Actual Production Data: Records detailing the actual quantity of finished goods produced for each Production Order within the Jan-May 2025 timeframe. Each order specifies the Product SKU and the specific BoM Revision used, as well as the actual stages completed for that order. This provides the basis for calculating actual material consumption per unit produced.

User-Provided Actual Material Transaction Data The Core of MFRO: Records generated during production detailing the Manufacturing Stage, Production Order, Waste/By-product Type, and Actual Quantity Recorded for every instance waste or by-product is captured, including those not tied to a BoM component process waste. Also includes records of actual input materials consumed.

User-Provided Actual Financial Transaction Data: Records of the actual revenue received from sales of collected by-products and the actual costs paid for the disposal of waste streams during the period.

Analysis Period: January 1, 2025 - May 31, 2025

Total Finished Goods Produced Across all styles: 7,100 PCS as per synthesized actual production data

Executive Summary: Overall Material Performance

Overall Material Efficiency: Analysis of total actual raw material input vs. total actual finished goods output converted to a common unit like KG shows ~71.0% efficiency. This means approximately 29% of total material input volume/weight did not end up in finished goods.

Net Financial Impact from Non-Product Outputs: Total Actual By-product Revenue generated $1,270 minus Total Actual Waste Disposal Costs 

12,250equalsanetcostof−
10,980 for managing waste and by-products during this period.

Volume Overview: Total Actual Waste Captured approx. 8,500 KG equivalent significantly outweighs Total Actual By-product Captured approx. 6,500 KG equivalent in raw volume.

Summary: The overall process efficiency is moderate, with almost a third of material input not becoming finished product. The company incurred a substantial net cost of $10,980 in Jan-May 2025 to manage these non-product material streams, indicating significant financial opportunity for optimization.

Pipeline Material Flow Analysis: Where Waste and By-products Occur

Analyzing actual material transaction data by stage reveals the key points of generation and separation:

Cutting Stage: Largest source of solid material loss by volume. Actual data shows Cutting generated approx. 60% of total solid waste volume Fabric Scraps and approx. 95% of collected solid by-product volume Selvedge, Baled Cardboard from roll cores.
Calculated Actual Waste Percentage of Input at Cutting: ~12.8% primarily fabric scraps.
Calculated Actual By-product Percentage of Input at Cutting: ~8.3% primarily selvedge & cardboard.

Washing/Finishing Stage: Largest source by financial impact. Actual data for this stage, primarily capturing process waste, reveals it is responsible for over 80% of total waste disposal costs due to high volumes of Wastewater WW-DYEFIN and Sludge SLUDGE-DYEFIN.
Calculated Actual Waste Volume from Washing/Finishing: Approx. 1,000,000 Liters Wastewater, 10,000 KG Sludge captured.

Sewing Stage: Generates component-related waste Thread Waste, Damaged Trims but contributes a relatively smaller volume and cost compared to Cutting or Washing/Finishing.
Calculated Actual Waste Percentage of Input at Sewing: ~1-2%.

Packing Stage: Primarily generates low volumes of plastic waste but contributes significant volume and revenue through the capture and baling of cardboard from shipping boxes.

Key Finding: The most costly waste streams are generated in the Washing/Finishing process, while the Cutting stage produces the highest volume of solid waste and by-products. Separation efforts are correctly focused at these key stages.

Waste & By-product Type Analysis: What are the Specific Streams & Their Financials

Analysis of actual captured quantities and financial transactions by Waste/By-product Type:

Top 3 Waste Types by Actual Disposal Cost:

WW-DYEFIN Wastewater: $8,000 actual disposal cost.

SLUDGE-DYEFIN Sludge: $1,800 actual disposal cost.

FAB-SCRAP-DENIM Denim Fabric Scraps: $1,500 actual disposal cost.
These three types account for over 90% of total waste disposal costs.

Top 2 By-product Types by Actual Revenue:

SELVEDGE-TRIM: $850 actual revenue generated.

CARDBOARD-BALED: $420 actual revenue generated.
These two types account for 100% of recorded by-product revenue.

Volume Composition: Denim Fabric Scraps and Baled Cardboard are the largest captured solid streams by weight. Wastewater is the largest liquid stream by volume.

Key Finding: Wastewater and Sludge disposal from the Washing/Finishing process are by far the largest financial burdens. Denim fabric scraps are the most costly solid waste type. Selvedge trim and baled cardboard are currently the only successfully monetized by-product streams, but their combined revenue is significantly less than disposal costs.

Thread Waste All Styles: Actual Thread Waste percentages ranging from 2.1% to 2.5% were consistently lower than the planned loss percentages 3% to 5% across all relevant BoMs. Variance: Favorable ranging from -0.5% to -2.9%. This resulted in significant material cost savings across the period.

Trim Waste Buttons, Rivets, Labels: Actual Trim Waste volumes were slightly higher than planned fixed-quantity loss for several components. Variance: Slightly Unfavorable. Small impact financially ~$80 total extra disposal cost but indicates minor handling inefficiencies.

By-product Capture vs. Planned Loss: The actual capture of Selvedge Trim and Baled Cardboard volumes demonstrates successful recovery processes capturing value from material streams where the BoM only indicated general component loss fabric, cartons or 0% loss.

Key Finding: The most critical area for operational improvement identified by variance analysis is the Cutting of Style 710 Women's Skinny Jeans, which significantly exceeded its planned waste rate. Style 505 cutting showed positive variance after the BoM revision. Thread usage is more efficient than planned. Trim waste is slightly worse than planned. By-product capture indicates successful recovery processes are in place, capturing value not explicitly detailed in the BoM's loss calculation alone.

Product & Material Specific Insights:

Style 710 Women's Skinny Jeans: This product demonstrates the highest actual fabric cutting waste percentage 13.3%, despite its BoM planning for a lower loss 10% than the men's denim. This suggests that the combination of the specific stretch fabric, the complex pattern marker for a skinny fit, or the cutting process parameters for this style are less efficient than standard denim.

POLO-BASIC-NAVY: This product is the primary contributor to the most expensive waste streams Wastewater, Sludge due to its garment dyeing process. While material input quantity per unit is lower than jeans, its process waste intensity is significantly higher.
Example: Polo generates ~500 Liters WW/piece vs. Jean generating ~50 Liters WW/piece.

FAB-STRETCH-B-007 10oz Stretch Denim: This specific fabric is associated with the highest actual cutting waste percentage compared to other fabrics during this period, regardless of product style cut from it though predominantly used for Style 710. This points to the material characteristics potentially contributing to the issue.

Key Finding: Style 710's cutting and the Polo Shirt's dyeing are the most impactful areas at the product/material level in terms of waste generation financial or volume.

Trend Analysis Jan - May 2025:

Overall Material Efficiency: Analysis of the trend over the 5 months shows a slight positive upward trend, moving from ~70% in Jan-Feb to ~72% in May.

Net Financial Impact: The large Wastewater disposal cost creates a consistently negative net impact. No significant positive trend change observed yet.

Cutting Waste Trend: The actual cutting waste percentage for Style 505 shows a clear decrease from March using Rev B to April using Rev C, validating the positive impact of the underlying process/pattern change or the new BoM target. Style 710 cutting waste remained consistently high Feb-May.

By-product Capture Trend: Actual captured volume and revenue for Baled Cardboard and Selvedge Trim show a stable or slightly increasing trend, indicating consistent collection processes are in place.

Key Finding: Trends indicate positive movement in fabric cutting efficiency for one key product Style 505. The major financial drain Wastewater requires targeted trend monitoring after any process changes.
